        <div class="paragraphBox"> SMASH Academy (Summer Math And Science Honors) is a program that I joined in 9th grade in order to find academic support, mentorship, opportunties and networking. I stayed at the UC Berkeley campus, slept in the dorms, ate in the dining halls and studied in the classrooms. It is one of the most significant, motivating and self-reassuring experiences of my life, and I am certain of my future today thanks to them.

                <br> SMASH was one of the earliest STEM education programs created in the United States as a way to prepare students of color for STEM college studies. The very first SMASH site program launched on the University of California, Berkeley campus in 2004, but it follows a decades long legacy of diversity and inclusion advocacy by our founder, Dr. Freada Kapor Klein.
