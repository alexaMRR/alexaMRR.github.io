                <b>Data Sovereignty </b>is the idea that data--in essence, information-- has a value and thus an owner. Data should be 
                maintained and controlled by those from who and where it’s collected. It balances keeping data safe and also using it to better 
                the societies it concerns. 
                <br> 
                <br>
                Data Sovereignty promotes <b>innovation, collaboration, and interoperability </b>, as listed by 
                <a href="https://internationaldataspaces.org/why/data-sovereignty/">International Data Spaces</a>. This means that 
                communities and organizations can benefit from their data being used to identify and address problems, unite the community,
                and make it easier to work other types of technology. 
                <br> 
                <br>
                Data Sovereignty is closely related to cybersecurity, data governance, and overall digital sovereignty.

                Indigenous Peoples rights and interests. Existing principles within the open data movement…primarily focus on 
                characteristics of data that will facilitate increased data sharing among entities while ignoring power differentials

                <b>Data Sovereignty </b> is essential Native and Indigenous governments' ability to function, serve their communities, 
                and address any issues within them. Accurate, whole data allows Indigenous communties to <b>manage information about their 
                water and land, maintain their history and documents, preserve their lingusitic and cultural assets, and be rightfully 
                recognized as independant and in control of their information. </b>
            <br>
            <br>
                This type of sovereignty over data and information allows enables <b>Indigenous-focused research, policy and infrastructure.</b>
                Native and Indigenous governments need reliable data to make decisions for their people, like any other sovereign institution. 
                Often, tribal and indigenous data is foreignly collected and maintained at a state or federal level. This leaves tribal 
                governments to deal “with the task of building strong nations while utilising data that have been collected to advance the aims 
                of other governments” <a href="https://doi.org/10.22459/CAEPR38.11.2016.01 ">(p. 254, Indigenous Data Sovereignty, Kukatai and Taylor) </a>
            <br> 
            <br>
           Data Sovereignty in Native and Indigenous communities at it's very core provides an increased level of self-determination and 
            independance.
